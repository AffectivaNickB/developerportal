## Introducing the Affdex SDK
The Affdex emotion-sensing Software Development Kit (SDK) captures and reports facial expressions of emotion. These emotion insights can be obtained from an optical sensor (e.g. a web camera), a video or even an image.

By integrating the Affdex SDK developers can create interactive and exciting emotion-aware applications and digital experiences. As users interact with their mobile or desktop devices using applications and digital experiences you have built with the Affdex SDK, their facial expressions are captured, analyzed and made available for further processing.

Based on Affectivaâ€™s highly accurate and patented science, the Affdex SDK provides unique and highly sophisticated emotion-sensing and analytics capabilities, yet provides emotion insights that are easy to interpret and process.

The Features of the Affdex SDK include:

* Capture facial expressions of emotion and feedback of emotion metrics in real time.
* Processes data obtained from optical sensors, such as a web camera, a video file, or still images.
* Flexible and easy to use API.
* Measures 7 emotions and 15 highly nuanced facial expressions.
* Two alternative metrics for measuring the emotional experience: valence and engagement.
* All processing done on device -- no videos or images sent to our cloud.
