This is a Jekyll theme intended for documentation projects. What makes this theme unique is the approach in using Jekyll for single sourcing, that is, producing multiple outputs from the same theme. For example, you might have 3 different help systems that you're generating from the same Jekyll files. More than anything, this Jekyll theme shows you how to use Jekyll for documentation projects from the perspective of a technical writer. 

Note that I'm using this theme for my own technical writing projects, so this is an evolving project.

## Intended audience

<<<<<<< HEAD
<h2 id="Measurements">Measurements</h2>
<p>The face provides a rich canvas of emotion. Humans are innately programmed to express and communicate emotion through facial expressions. Affdex scientifically measures and reports facial expressions using sophisticated computer vision and machine learning techniques. When you use the Affdex Mobile SDK in your applications, you will receive facial expression output from Affdex in the form of Affdex metrics: expression metrics and emotional metrics.

<p>
Expression metrics are scores that indicate when users make a specific facial expression (e.g., a smile) along with the degree of intensity. The metrics can be thought of as expression detectors: as the expression occurs and intensifies, the score rises from 0 (no expression) to 100 (expression fully present). In addition, we also expose a composite emotional metric called valence which gives feedback on the overall experience. Valence measures 0 to 100 indicate a neutral to positive experience, while -100 to 0 indicate a negative to neutral experience.

Although this theme could be used for any website, I'm assuming that my main audience involves technical writers. Very few technical writers are even aware of Jekyll as a platform, let alone how to use it for tech comm scenarios. The instructions for this theme, therefore, are extensive because they discuss a lot of Jekyll basics as well. I'm not going to assume that you're already familiar with Jekyll, or that you're a UX guru, or that you know how to do backflips in Liquid. I'll try to hold your hand as much as possible.

<h2 id="Getting The Best Results">Getting The Best Results</h2>
The Affdex Mobile SDK builds on Affdex real-world experience analyzing billions of faces worldwide, both online and offline. The SDK robustly handles gender, age, and ethnicity, and has been cross-culturally validated on real-world data.  While accommodating a variety of lighting conditions and head orientations, the SDK produces best results when people face the screen and facial features are visible. Obstructions to the face, such as a hand over the mouth, will result in a temporary loss of facial expression data so developers should prompt users to avoid such obstructions.

## Supported features
>>>>>>> parent of 1f9b540... tags and homepage

As far as I can tell, Jekyll supports most of the features a technical writer needs to author and publish content. Most importantly, using Jekyll allows you to take full advantage of a modern web development platform. 

As a quick overview, this theme specifically provides the following:

* Bootstrap framework with responsive design
* Integrated search
* Navigation sidebar and top navigation
* Font Awesome
* Options for creating multiple builds for different audiences

See {{supported_features}} for an extensive list.
