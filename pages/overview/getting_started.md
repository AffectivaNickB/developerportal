## Why Emotion-Enable Your Applications?

We live in a world that’s highly connected, full of incredibly smart devices and interactive digital experiences.  Yet emotions are missing from the digital world.  At Affectiva, we have made it our mission to bring emotional intelligence to the digital world. And to make this vision a reality, we have created our SDK so that others can bring emotion-sensing and analytics to their own offerings, be it digital experiences, apps, games, devices, or other technologies.

Using our SDK, developers can now enrich digital experiences and apps with emotion-sensing and analytics.  Devices can now instantly respond to a user's unfiltered emotions, and apps can adjust their interfaces and flow to better suit moods. This makes for a more authentic, interactive, and unique experience.

## Technology

The Affdex SDK is built on Affectiva's industry-leading patented science. It’s designed to analyze spontaneous facial expressions that people show in their daily interactions.  The highly accurate emotion recognition algorithms (classifiers) have been trained and tested using Affectiva’s massive emotion data repository - the world’s largest emotion database with more than 3.2 million faces from 75 countries analyzed, amounting to over 12 billion emotion data points. Designed for developer ease-of-use, processing of the emotion data is on-device (no cloud round trip), and the library is lightweight and fast to support a small memory footprint and real time processing.

## How To Use The SDK?

### Live video feeds

The SDKs include classes to help extract emotion metrics directly from any optical sensor such as a web camera, including front and back facing cameras in the case of mobile devices.

### Recorded videos

A recorded video file that resides on the file system of the device can also be used as an input. The SDKs include support for opening all the major video formats.

A list of supported file types can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/supportedfiletypes/).

### Photographs

The SDK also includes the capability to generate emotion metrics from individual images (photographs). 

## Supported Platformss

With the SDKs, developers can emotion-enable apps and digital experiences for [Android]({{ site.baseurl }}/android/), [iOS]({{ site.baseurl }}/ios/), and [Windows]({{ site.baseurl }}/windows/) 

Please refer to the technical documentation of each of the platforms for their requirements. To get started, sign up to download the SDKs through <a href="http://www.affectiva.com/solutions/apis-sdks/" target=_blank>our SDK site</a>.
