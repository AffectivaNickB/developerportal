# What is a metric?

A metric is simply a measure of the overall expressiveness of the participant. Metrics are given a score or value that ranges between zero and one hundred (0 - 100).


## Valence

A measure of the positive (or negative) nature of the participant’s expression. If participants tend to be displaying more positive emotions Valence increases on the positive side or if morenegative emotions are expressed Valence decreases toward the negative side. (-100 - 100)



## Engagement

A measure of the participant’s attention to the screen, using the orientation of the face to assess if they are looking directly at the screen or if they are distracted (turning away) while viewing content. (0 - 100)

## Smile

The degree to which the participant is displaying a smile. The smile classifier looks at the full face rather than just the mouth/lip area, incorporating other facial cues, like the eyes, to accurately indicate a true smile. (0 - 100)
